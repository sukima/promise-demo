# Promises Demo

Goals:

- Make a list of object (large)
- Each object returns a promise which is resolved after a timeout
- When resolved (or rejected) then place it in the HTML
- As promises get resolved run a tally counter

Optional:

- Have the data builder return a promise (for non blocking execution)
- Sort objects by ID
- Add florishing (animations / make pretty)
